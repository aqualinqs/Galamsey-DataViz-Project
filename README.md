## 📊 Project Overview
The **Ghana Beyond Galamsey Monitoring System** is a data-driven Streamlit application that visualizes, analyzes, and predicts the impacts of illegal mining (**Galamsey**) on Ghana's water resources. It provides:
- Heavy metal concentration analysis (Arsenic, Chromium, Lead, Cadmium)
- pH level monitoring across rivers
- Predictive insights for environmental and public health interventions
- Prescriptive recommendations to guide water resource management

## 🌍 Why This Matters
Illegal mining severely pollutes rivers, impacting livelihoods, ecosystems, and the economy. This dashboard empowers:
- Policymakers
- Water resource managers
- Environmentalists
- Communities

To **act early** using **data-backed insights**.

---

## 🚿 Features
- **Visualize** heavy metal levels across 12 major rivers
- **Analyze** pH levels and acidity threats
- **Receive Smart Recommendations** based on pollution thresholds
- **Professional UI** with tabs, loading animations, and real-time alerts


## 📊 Dataset
The app uses a curated dataset containing:
- Rivers: Oda, Birim, Pra, Ankobra, Subri, etc.
- Parameters: Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb), pH

Compared against WHO, US EPA, and Ghana Standards for safe water quality thresholds.
